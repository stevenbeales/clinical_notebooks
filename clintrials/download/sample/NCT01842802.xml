        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A healthy non-smoking male or female between 20-60 years of age

          -  Subjects presenting excess abdominal tissue (fat and skin), are candidates for an
             abdominoplasty procedure and are willing to allow the use of this device on their
             skin

          -  Subjects who will allow the excess skin removed as part of the abdominoplasty to be
             sent for laboratory analysis

          -  Understand and accept the obligation associated with the procedure

          -  Subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I to III.

          -  Subjects who are willing to consent to participate in the study will be asked to
             undergo biopsies, ultrasound measurements, and blood testing as outlined for each
             group and defined in section 6.0.

          -  Subjects must agree to maintain the same diet and exercise regime throughout the
             study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previous liposuction/lipo-sculpture or any type of procedure in the abdominal
             area in the past 6 months

          -  A history of allergic reactions to medications or anesthesia required for the
             procedure

          -  A history of thrombophlebitis

          -  A history of acute infections

          -  A history of heart failure

          -  Received or is anticipated to receive antiplatelets, anticoagulants, thrombolytics,
             vitamin E or anti-inflammatories within 2 weeks pre treatment

          -  Intolerance to anesthesia or medications to be prescribed before or after the
             procedure.

          -  Any medical condition, that, in the investigator's opinion would interfere with the

          -  Taking medications that are photosensitive

          -  A history of keloid formation

          -  A study subject must not be pregnant or have been pregnant in the last 3 months

          -  The physician has the right to make determination of eligibility as he/she deems
